# RandomizedGreedyMPS
Code associated with the publication "Randomized greedy magic point selection schemes for nonlinear model reduction" by R. Zimmermann/Kai Cheng

The code implements 
* a full-order model
* a POD-based reduced order model
* a POD-DEIM based reduced order model
for the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation.

The theoretical background is given in Section 3.3. of the associated paper.
